/**
 * TTL Monitor for Soroban State Archival Prevention (Issue #58).
 *
 * Stellar's Soroban ledger enforces state expiration: any persistent entry
 * whose TTL (time-to-live, measured in ledgers) drops below the minimum
 * will be archived and become unreadable until a `RestoreFootprint`
 * transaction is submitted to bring it back.
 *
 * For an address that has been dormant for ~30 days (the contract's current
 * `TTL_EXTEND_LEDGERS` window) its reputation and trust-history entries can
 * reach the archive threshold.  If a lending protocol then calls
 * `get_trust_score(dormant_address)` on the live chain, the host will reject
 * the transaction before the contract code runs.
 *
 * `TtlMonitor` addresses this by:
 *
 * 1. Querying the Soroban RPC for the current TTL of each high-value address's
 *    persistent storage entries using `getLedgerEntries`.
 * 2. Comparing each TTL against a configurable threshold
 *    (`ttlRefreshThresholdLedgers`, default: 241,920 ≈ 14 days).
 * 3. Submitting a `restore_reputation(address)` transaction (via
 *    `SorobanClient.bumpReputationTtl`) for every address whose TTL is at or
 *    below the threshold, refreshing it to the full 518,400-ledger window.
 *
 * The monitor is intentionally **non-blocking**: a failure to bump one address
 * is logged but does not abort the scan.  Concurrency is bounded by
 * `bumpConcurrency` (default: 5) to avoid overwhelming the RPC endpoint.
 *
 * ## High-value address selection
 *
 * A "high-value" address is one that has appeared in the indexer's event
 * stream at least once (i.e. it has reputation data on-chain).  The caller
 * is responsible for supplying the list — `TtlMonitor` only does the TTL
 * check and the bump.  In the `startTtlMonitorCron` integration, the list
 * comes from a `SELECT DISTINCT party_a FROM commitment_outcomes` query on
 * the TimescaleDB database.
 *
 * ## Ledger entry key encoding
 *
 * The contract stores reputation data under two Soroban persistent keys:
 *
 * ```
 * ReputationKey::ReputationV2(address)  – V2 (Phase C) row
 * ReputationKey::Reputation(address)    – V1 (Phase B) legacy row
 * TrustKey::TrustHistory(address)       – trust-score time-decay history
 * ```
 *
 * `getLedgerEntries` requires XDR-encoded `LedgerKey` values.  The monitor
 * uses the `ContractData` XDR variant with the contract ID and the matching
 * ScVal to compute the live TTL.  When `getLedgerEntries` returns
 * `expirationLedger` for a key, `ttl = expirationLedger - latestLedger`; a
 * missing key means the entry was never written or is already archived.
 */
