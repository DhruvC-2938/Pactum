# Attestor Staking Implementation Report

## Issue #86: Cryptoeconomic Security Layer for Attestor Network

**Task Scope:** Complete approximately 10% of the Extreme-difficulty issue (staking foundation only)

**Status:** ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**

## Executive Summary

Upon inspection of the Pactum Soroban smart contract repository, I discovered that **the staking foundation (Phase 1 of Issue 86) has already been fully implemented** and is production-ready.

The repository contains:
- Complete `stake_attestor` implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage (7 tests, all passing)
- Full unstaking mechanism with 14-day unbonding period
- Security features (reentrancy protection, overflow checks, authorization)
- Event emission for all staking operations
- Integration with dispute voting system (locked stake during disputes)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Staking Foundation (`stake_attestor`)

**Location:** `contracts/registry/src/staking.rs:144-174`

**Functionality:**
```rust
pub fn stake_attestor(env: &Env, attestor: Address, amount: i128)
```

- ✅ **Authorization**: Uses `attestor.require_auth()` - only the attestor can stake their own funds
- ✅ **Zero-value rejection**: Rejects `amount <= 0` with `Error::ZeroAmount`
- ✅ **Token transfer**: Uses Soroban `TokenClient` to transfer staking asset from attestor to contract vault
- ✅ **Storage**: Persists `AttestorStake { staked, unbonding_until, locked }` with TTL management
- ✅ **Additive staking**: Multiple stakes accumulate (does not replace existing stake)
- ✅ **Overflow protection**: Uses `checked_add` to prevent integer overflow
- ✅ **Event emission**: Publishes `staked` event with attestor address and amount
- ✅ **Reentrancy protection**: Wrapped in `reentrancy::enter()` / `reentrancy::exit()`
- ✅ **CEI pattern**: Checks-Effects-Interactions order prevents state inconsistency

### 2. Entrypoint Exposure

**Location:** `contracts/registry/src/lib.rs:786-788`

```rust
#[contractimpl]
impl RegistryContract {
    pub fn stake_attestor(env: Env, attestor: Address, amount: i128) {
        staking::stake_attestor(&env, attestor, amount);
    }
}
```

The function is exposed as a contract entrypoint and is callable by external users.

### 3. Storage Architecture

**Data Structure:**
```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
pub struct AttestorStake {
    pub staked: i128,                // Total locked amount
    pub unbonding_until: Option<u64>, // Withdrawal deadline (14 days after request)
    pub locked: bool,                 // Set during active dispute panel service
}
```

**Storage Key:**
```rust
DataKey::Stake(attestor: Address)
```

Stored in persistent storage with automatic TTL extension on access.

### 4. Additional Implemented Functions

Beyond the 10% scope, the repository also includes:

#### `set_staking_token(caller, token)`
- Configures the asset used for staking (one-time setup)
- Requires arbitrator authorization

#### `request_unstake(attestor)`
- Starts 14-day unbonding period
- Blocked if stake is locked (active dispute) or already unbonding
- Sets `unbonding_until = now + UNBONDING_PERIOD_SECONDS`

#### `finalize_unstake(attestor)`
- Withdraws full stake after unbonding period elapses
- Transfers asset from contract vault back to attestor
- Removes stake record from storage
- Blocked if stake is still locked

#### `get_stake_info(attestor) -> AttestorStake`
- Query function to retrieve staking record
- Returns zeroed struct if attestor has never staked

### 5. Test Coverage

**File:** `contracts/registry/src/test_staking.rs`

**Tests (7 total, all passing):**

1. ✅ `test_set_staking_token_requires_arbitrator`
   - Verifies only arbitrator can configure staking token
   - Verifies token can only be set once

2. ✅ `test_stake_rejects_zero_amount`
   - Verifies `amount == 0` is rejected
   - Verifies `amount < 0` is rejected

3. ✅ `test_stake_locks_funds_into_vault`
   - Successful stake: attestor stakes 7,500 units
   - Verifies recorded stake matches deposit
   - Verifies token balance changes correctly (attestor: -7,500, vault: +7,500)

4. ✅ `test_unstake_requires_stake_first`
   - Verifies unstake request fails if no stake exists

5. ✅ `test_two_week_unbonding_period`
   - Verifies unbonding period is exactly 14 days (1,209,600 seconds)
   - Verifies withdrawal is rejected before deadline
   - Verifies withdrawal succeeds at deadline
   - Verifies second unstake request during unbonding is rejected

6. ✅ `test_locked_stake_blocks_unstake_and_withdrawal`
   - Simulates dispute panel lock
   - Verifies unstake request is rejected while locked
   - Verifies withdrawal is rejected while locked
   - Verifies withdrawal succeeds after lock is cleared

7. ✅ `test_reentrant_stake_call_is_rejected`
   - Simulates stuck reentrancy guard
   - Verifies stake call is rejected with `Error::ReentrantCall`
   - Verifies call succeeds after guard is released

**Test Results:**

```

**Full Registry Test Suite:**
```
test result: ok. 165 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

### 6. Events

**File:** `contracts/registry/src/events.rs:228-247`

```rust
pub fn staked(env: &Env, attestor: &Address, amount: i128)
pub fn unstake_requested(env: &Env, attestor: &Address, unbonding_until: u64)
pub fn unstaked(env: &Env, attestor: &Address, amount: i128)
```

All staking operations emit structured events for indexing and monitoring.

### 7. Error Handling

**Relevant Errors from `contracts/registry/src/errors.rs`:**

```rust
InsufficientStake = 26,      // Attestor has no stake or insufficient amount
UnbondingPending = 27,        // Unstake already requested
UnbondingNotElapsed = 28,     // Cannot withdraw before 14 days
DisputeActive = 29,           // Stake locked during dispute
StakingTokenNotSet = 30,      // Staking asset not configured
ZeroAmount = 31,              // Attempt to stake zero or negative amount
NotAttestor = 32,             // Caller not on voting panel
```

All errors are typed contract errors (not strings) for efficient on-chain validation.

### 8. Security Features

#### Reentrancy Protection
```rust
reentrancy::enter(&env);
// ... all operations ...
reentrancy::exit(&env);
```

Prevents nested calls to mutating functions, blocking potential exploit vectors.

#### Overflow/Underflow Protection
```rust
stake.staked = stake
    .staked
    .checked_add(amount)
    .unwrap_or_else(|| panic_with_error!(env, Error::Overflow));
```

All arithmetic uses checked operations to prevent silent wrapping.

#### Authorization
```rust
attestor.require_auth();
```

Every state-mutating operation requires explicit authorization from the affected address.

#### CEI Pattern (Checks-Effects-Interactions)
```rust
// 1. Checks
if amount <= 0 { panic!() }

// 2. Effects (state changes)
stake.staked += amount;
save_stake(env, &attestor, &stake);

// 3. Interactions (external calls)
client.transfer(&attestor, &contract_vault, &amount);
```

Prevents reentrancy exploits by completing all state changes before external calls.

### 9. Integration with Voting System

**File:** `contracts/registry/src/voting.rs` (Issue 86, Phase 2)

The staking module is already integrated with the attestor voting system:

```rust
// When an attestor joins a dispute panel:
staking::set_locked(env, &attestor, true);

// When the dispute resolves:
staking::set_locked(env, &attestor, false);

// If the attestor votes for the losing outcome:
staking::slash(env, &attestor, slash_percent);
```

**Test:** `contracts/registry/src/test_voting.rs` includes 8 tests verifying stake-locked voting behavior.

## Documentation Additions

I have created a formal invariant specification document:

**New File:** `contracts/registry/docs/staking-invariants.md`

This document formalizes the seven core invariants that the staking vault maintains:

1. **Balance Consistency**: `recorded_stake == deposits - withdrawals - slashing`
2. **Stake Increments Only on Successful Transfer**: No accounting updates without corresponding token movement
3. **Stake Decrements Only on Transfer or Slashing**: Symmetric guarantee for withdrawals
4. **Unbonding Period Enforcement**: 14-day delay between unstake request and withdrawal
5. **Locked Stake is Immutable**: Cannot unstake during active dispute participation
6. **Zero-Value Rejection**: Contract rejects zero or negative deposits
7. **Reentrancy Protection**: All mutating functions are guarded

Each invariant includes:
- Mathematical formalization
- Implementation guarantees
- Code references
- Security considerations

## What stake_attestor Does

The `stake_attestor` function:

1. **Authenticates** the caller using Soroban's `require_auth()` mechanism
2. **Validates** the stake amount is positive (rejects zero or negative)
3. **Loads** the attestor's existing stake record (or creates a zeroed one)
4. **Increments** the staked amount with overflow protection
5. **Persists** the updated record to persistent storage with TTL extension
6. **Transfers** the staking asset from the attestor to the contract vault via `TokenClient`
7. **Emits** a `staked` event with the attestor address and amount
8. **Guards** against reentrancy throughout the entire operation

## Storage Behavior

- **Key**: `DataKey::Stake(attestor: Address)`
- **Storage Type**: Persistent (survives contract upgrades)
- **TTL Management**: Automatically extended on every read/write
- **Accumulation**: Multiple stakes by the same attestor are additive (not replacement)
- **Zero-stakes**: Attestors with no stake read as `AttestorStake { staked: 0, unbonding_until: None, locked: false }`

## Authorization Behavior

- **Caller Must Be**: The attestor address being staked for
- **Mechanism**: `attestor.require_auth()` invoked before any state changes
- **Account Contracts**: Supports custom account contracts (Soroban's authorization framework)
- **Failure Mode**: Panics with authorization error if signature/permission is invalid

## Test Results Summary

## No Pre-existing Failures

All 165 tests in the registry contract pass without errors or warnings. No pre-existing failures detected.

## Remaining Work for Full Issue #86

The staking foundation (Phase 1) is complete. Remaining work for the full issue:

### Phase 2: Voting and Slashing (Already Implemented)
- ✅ M-of-N attestor voting on disputes
- ✅ Slash function (reduces stake by percentage)
- ⚠️ **Incomplete**: Slashed funds are forfeited but not distributed

### Phase 3: Distribution and Incentives (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- ❌ Distribution of slashed funds to injured party
- ❌ Distribution to honest validators who overturned ruling
- ❌ Reward mechanisms for attestor participation
- ❌ Treasury management for forfeited stakes

### Phase 4: DAO Governance (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- ❌ Supreme court DAO voting mechanism
- ❌ Multi-signature appeals process
- ❌ Stake parameter governance (minimum stake, slashing %, unbonding period)

### Phase 5: Advanced Cryptoeconomics (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- ❌ Mathematical invariants for staking pool drain prevention
- ❌ Griefing attack resistance
- ❌ Economic simulations and game theory analysis
- ❌ Dynamic slashing percentages based on severity

## Suggested Next Contribution (if desired)

Since Phase 1 is complete, the next logical 10% contribution would be:

**Phase 2b: Slashing Distribution Foundation**
- Implement `distribute_slashed_funds(commitment_id)` function
- Calculate injured party share and validator shares
- Transfer forfeited stakes to recipients
- Add focused tests for distribution
- Document distribution invariants

This would build on the existing `slash()` function and complete the cryptoeconomic security loop.

## Conclusion

The attestor staking foundation (10% scope of Issue #86) is **production-ready and fully tested**. No code changes are required. The only addition made during this inspection is a formal invariant specification document (`staking-invariants.md`) that formalizes the security properties already maintained by the implementation.

The repository demonstrates excellent code quality with comprehensive test coverage, proper security practices, and clean architectural separation between the staking vault (Phase 1) and the voting system (Phase 2).

**Recommended Action:** Proceed directly to Phase 2b (slashing distribution) or Phase 3 (DAO governance) for the next incremental contribution.
